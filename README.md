# NOTES APP 

Hi there and welcome!

This is the Back End of the note taking app. 
This is where all the magic happens. Requests for creating, updating and removing a note are handled here. 

It is from the [fullstackopen] course that is offered by the univesity of Helsinki.

## Technologies used in building the app

- The back end is built using the Node.js together with the Express.js framework.
- The Database used is MongoDB with the really awesome mongoose as the connector. DB as a service is from Atlas.
- The entire project is hosted on Heroku where you can host dynamic sites for free. Shout out to them too.
- User authentication is performed using jsonwebtokens and hashing of user passwords is done by bcrypt. 
- The linter used for code consistency is eslint.(God this was a pain in the ass when your not consistent with your coding style).
- The unit tests are performed using JEST (yay! Facebook) while end to end testing using Cypress.
