# NOTES APP BACK END

Hi there and welcome!

This is the Back end of the note taking app.

It is from the [fullstackopen] course that is offered by the univesity of Helsinki.

<br />

## Technologies used in building the app

- The back end is built .
- The linter used for code consistency is eslint.(God this was a pain in the ass when your not consistent with your coding style).
- The unit tests are performed using JEST (yay! Facebook) while end to end testing using Cypress.
