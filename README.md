# NOTES APP BACK END

Hi there and welcome!

This is the Back end of the note taking app.

It is from the [fullstackopen] course that is offered by the univesity of Helsinki.

<br />

## Technologies used in building the app

- The back end .
- The linter used for code consistency is eslint.(God this was a pain in the ass when your not consistent with your coding style).
- The unit tests are performed using JEST (yay! Facebook) while end to end testing using Cypress.
- There are also dependancies that deserve honourable mentions.

  - 

<br />

## Running the application locally

- I do not oftenly push this code to the the heroku master and deploy it to the internet so here are the instructions for running the app locally.

- Make sure you have node and git installed and are familiar with how it works.
- clone this repository.
- change directory into the notes app directory.
- Install all the required node modules. Dependacies and what not.
- Start the front end using the npm script. Make sure also that you have the [notes_app] back end server running too.

                    [git] clone https://github.com/jim4067/notes_app_frontend.git
                    [cd] notes_app_front_end
                    [npm] i
                    [npm] start

This is the end but thanks for taking the time to read. The url to the web app is at [notes app frontend]
